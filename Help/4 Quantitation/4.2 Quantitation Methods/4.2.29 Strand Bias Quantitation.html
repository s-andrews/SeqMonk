<h1>Strand Bias Quantitation</h1>

<p>
This method quantitates based on the directionality of your reads.
</p>
<p>
The equation used is (reverse-forward)/(reverse+forward) so you end up
with a value between -1 and +1 depending on the bias in directionality.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<p>
You can set a minimum count so that you don't add a lot of noise based 
on probes containing very few reads.  Minimum count is based on the total
of reverse + forward so reads with no associated strand are ignored.
