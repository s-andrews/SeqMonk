<h1>Reporting Bugs</h1>
<p>
If you find a problem with SeqMonk please try the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Check our <a href="9.1%20Common%20Problems.html">Common Problems Page</a> to see
if there is a solution already listed</li>
<li>Check that you are running the latest version of SeqMonk.  You can see the
version you are running by selecting Help &gt; About and you can check the
SeqMonk website (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/) to
see what the latest version is</li>
<li>Report a bug!</li>
</ol>

<p>
The easiest way to report a bug is to use our online bug reporting and tracking
system at https://github.com/s-andrews/SeqMonk/issues.  Alternatively you
can email the report to simon.andrews@babraham.ac.uk.
</p>
<p>
We are also keen to hear suggestions for new functionality you would like to 
see in SeqMonk, or ways in which we could improve the usability of the
functions which are already there.  You can let us know about these by filing them
as a bug with a severity of 'enhancement'.
