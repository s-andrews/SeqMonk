<h1>Grouping Samples</h1>
<p>
In many experiment designs it makes sense to group together a set of
samples so they are treated as a single data store.  There are two
ways to group samples in SeqMonk and they serve different purposes.
</p>

<ol>
<li>DataGroups: A data group is a way to merge together data from multiple
data sets, where the data should be considered as a single biological sample.
You would use this if, for example, you did several sequencing runs on the
same library and wanted to be able to look at the results all together.
DataGroups can be quantitated but they can't be used to assess the reproducibility
of the values in the datasets from which they are built.
</li>
<li>Replicate Sets: A replicate set is a way to group together DataSets and
DataGroups which represent biological replicates of related samples.  They don't
store any data and they aren't quantitated - their quantiation merely shows the
mean of the quantitated values for their component DataStores.  Replicate Sets
are used to provide sample grouping for statistical filters which compare two
groups of samples.
</li>



<p> Because quantitation in SeqMonk must be performed on both DataSets and 
DataGroups it is important that you create your groups as early as possible.
</p>
<p>
You can create data groups by selecting Data &gt; Edit Groups. You can make
as many groups as you like and assign as many samples as you like to each
group.  If it makes sense you can assign the same sample to more than one
group - for example in the screenshot below the Male WT sample could be
part of the male and WT groups.

The data group editor allows you to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Create New groups</li>
<li>Add or remove samples from existing groups</li>
<li>Rename groups</li>
<li>Delete Groups (note that this will NOT delete the samples in the group)</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you need to create groups in your experiment then it's a good idea to 
put all samples into groups (even if the group only contains one DataSet).  This
is beacuse when you come to doing quantitation this will act by default on
just the DataGroups if you have any defined (although you can change this if
you need to).
</p>

<p>
You create replicate sets in much the same way as data groups.  First select 
Data &gt; Edit Replicate Sets and then from the dialog which opens you can
create or delete replicate sets and add or remove DataStores from sets which
already exist. You can put a data store into more than one replicate set if
this makes sense for your data.
</p>

<h2>Autosplitting</h2>
<p>
If you have files which have a systematic naming scheme then you can use this to 
divide them into data groups or replicate sets.  If you select Data &gt; Auto
Create Groups/Sets then you can supply a list of text strings which will be matched
against your data set names and any datasets containing each pattern will be added
to a data group or replicate set with the same name.  If you want to have multiple
text strings matched then you can use a pipe charachter to separate them.
