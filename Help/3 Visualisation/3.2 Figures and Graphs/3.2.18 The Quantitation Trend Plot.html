<h1>The Quantitation Trend Plot</h1>

<p>
The quantitation trend plot is related to the probe trend plot in that it generates 
a profile over a set of genomic regions to look for trends which may not be apparent
from looking at individual instances.
</p>
<p>
The quantitation trend plot starts from a set of quantitated probes and then uses 
the values in these probes to generate a profile around a set of features.  Any
probes which map to the region used for the plot are averaged to generate an overall
picture of the quantitation around the features.  The probe trend plot does something
similar based on probe density, but the quantitation trend plot can use more complex
measures (methylation percentages for example) to achieve the same effect.

<h2>Options</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can choose the regions to be plotted.  These are defined from a set of features
and the quantitated region can be upstream, downstream or surrounding these features.  To
generate a sensible plot your probes should be smaller regions occurring within the region
you choose for this plot.</li>

<li>You can remove exactly duplicated features from inclusion in the average</li>
<li>You can choose to ignore the strand information of features and always treat them from
left to right on the top genomic strand</li>
