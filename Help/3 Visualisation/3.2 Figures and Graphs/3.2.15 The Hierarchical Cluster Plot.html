<h1>The Hierarchical Profile Plot</h1>

<p>
The hierarchical profile plot is a graphical method of clustering
together sets of probes whose values show related changes over
at least 3 different data stores.
</p>
<p>
There are two modes in which the tool operates - you can choose to 
do a per-probe normalisation which will use a correlation based
clustering to find probes with similar shaped quantitation profiles, or
you can take the current quantitation to do a euclidean clustering 
on the basis of the smallest absolute difference between probe
quantitation values.
</p>

<p>
The plot works best with small sets of probes (fewer than 5000 if you 
want it to complete in a sensible amount of time), which you already
know show significant changes between the conditions you are plotting.
Taking the results of the intensity difference filter, or a plain
difference filter woudl be a good basis for this plot.
</p>

<p>
The plot constructs a hierarchical grouping of your probes based
on the degree of correlation across the datastores which are
currently visible.  The results are then plotted on a heatmap where
the colours represent the signal level for that probe in that
datastore.  The values for this plot are normalised across the
set of datastores (ie the median value for each probe is subtracted
from the actual values for that probe in each of the data stores)
so that the values are more easily compared on the plot.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<p>There are no options to set when actually constructing the
plot.  There are some display options within the plot though</p>

<ul>
<li>Using the slider on the right of the plot you can change the 
colour scaling for the plot to emphasise the parts of the plot
you want to see more clearly.
</li>

<li>
Using the slider of the left you can change the R-value threshold
used to indicate the sets of related reads (shown by black lines
across the plot) in the plot.
</li>

<li> You can zoom into the plot by clicking and dragging in the 
main plot window.  You can zoom out again by right clicking.</li>

<li> You can save the set of currently visible clusters using
the "Save Clusters" button at the bottom.  Only clusters which 
are completely visible in the current view will be saved.  They
will appear as a child of the probe list used to initially
construct the plot.</li>
</ul>

<li> You can use the drop-down box at the top to select from a range
of different colour gradients, and can invert any of these using
the checkbox next to it</li>
