<h1>The DataStore Tree</h1>

<p>The DataStore tree view is a very quick way of being able to see the degree
of relatedness of several DataStores</p>

<p><img src="datastore_tree.png" alt="The DataStore Tree"></p>

<p>
This view uses a Pearson correlation to calculate a distance matrix between
all of the currently visible data stores.  It then constructs a neighbour
joining tree from the matrix.
</p>

<p>
You need to have at least 3 visible quantitated DataStores to draw a tree.  To begin
drawing your tree select Plots &gt; DataStore Tree from the main menu.
</p>

<p>
Once you have drawn the tree you can use the "Reorder" button at the bottom to change
the order of your visible data tracks to reflect the correlations found in the 
tree.
