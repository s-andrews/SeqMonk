<h1>Searching</h1>
<p>
Rather than manually moving around the genome there are a couple of 
different search tools you can use to quickly take you to a region
of interest.
</p>
<h2>Goto Position</h2>
<p>
If you know the genomic coordinates of the region you want to go to
you can select Edit &gt; Goto position and manually enter the position
you want to see.  The chromosome view will immediately update to show
this region.  You can either enter chromosome, start and end separately
or if you have a location string from another source (eg chr1:500-1000)
then you can paste this into the location box - this understands locations
both with and without the intial chr on the chromosome name.
</p>

<p>
The box also keeps a record of the last few locations you've been to do
you can also use this to jump back to somewhere you've been recently.
</p>

<h2>Goto Window</h2>
Sometimes you want to have a view window of a given size, centred on
a point you know.  Rather than have to work out the values to use in
the Goto Position dialog you can use Edit &gt; Goto Window and put
these values in directly.

<h2>Search for Features</h2>
<p>
If you want to find a particular annotation feature then you can use 
the Find Feature tool.  To launch this you select Edit &gt; Find Feature.
</p>
<p>
The find feature tool searches for a single word or phrase in the 
annotation for all of the features in the current genome.  You can limit
your search to just the feature names, or you can search through the
whole set of annotation.  You can also limit your search to a particular
type of feature.
</p>

<p>
Once you have a list of results you can sort these by clicking on any
of the column headers in the results table.
</p>
<p>
If you want to see a feature in the chromosome view you can double
click on any line of the feature results and the view will immediately
jump to show the region covered by that feature.
</p>
<p>
From within the results window of the feature search dialog you can easily
turn the results of your search into a new annotation track.  You can 
add all search results as a new track by pressing &quot;Save all as annotation track&quot;
or you can select just a subset and then press &quot;Save selected as annotation track&quot;
