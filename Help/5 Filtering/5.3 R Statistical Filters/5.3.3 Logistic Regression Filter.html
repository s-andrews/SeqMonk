<h1>Logistic Regression Filter</h1>

<p>This is an R based filter so will only be available if you have configured
R in the SeqMonk preferences and installed the pre-requisite packages</p>

<p>
The logistic regression filter is of use for data sets where you are interested in
the difference in the proportion of forward and reverse reads in two replicate
sets which each have at least 3 data stores in them.  It is most commonly used for
the analysis of replicated bisulphite sequencing data.
</p>


<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
<li>You need to two Replicate Sets to compare from the list on the left.</li>
<li>You need to select a p-value cutoff for the filter</li>
<li>You can choose to pre-filter your data by an absolute difference in the 
percentage of forward reads in the two data sets</li>
</ul>
