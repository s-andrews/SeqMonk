<h1>EdgeR Filter</h1>

<p>This is an R based filter so will only be available if you have configured
R in the SeqMonk preferences and installed the pre-requisite packages</p>

<p>
This filter can be used for differential count analysis.  It is normally used
in RNA-Seq workflows, but can actually be applied to many different experiment
types where the underlying data is a set of read counts.
</p>

<p>The filter allows you to select two replicate sets with at least two data stores
in each and will identify probes whose representation in the two sets differs
significantly.</p>

<p>For this filter to run correctly your data must fulfil two criteria</p>

<ol>
<li>Your quantitation must be raw, uncorrected read counts.  If you're using the
RNA-Seq filter then you must select the &quot;Generate Raw Counts&quot; option.  For
other probe types you must use the read count quantitation with no normalisation
or log transformation applied</li>

<li>You must use either all probes, or a representative subset of probes which are
not biased by the differences between the two replicate sets your tring to compare</li>

</ol>

<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
<li>You need to two Replicate Sets to compare from the list on the left.</li>
<li>You need to select a p-value cutoff for the filter</li>
<li>You can select whether multiple testing correction should be applied to 
your results.  For your p-values to be valid you must leave this box checked</li>
</ul>
