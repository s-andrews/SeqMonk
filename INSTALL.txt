Installing SeqMonk
-------------------

Windows
-------

Download the seqmonk zip file, and unzip it on your machine.  Windows has a 
virtual filesystem view of zip files which allows you to look at the contents in windows
explorer without actually unzipping the file - this isn't enough to run seqmonk, you need
to right click on the zip file and extract the contents to a conventional folder.  Once
you've done that just double click seqmonk.exe to run the program.

You may find that the first time you run the app you get a Windows Smart Screen dialog
saying that the app has been blocked.  You may be able to click on the button which 
says "Run anyway", or you might have to click on a link to "more information" and then
click on the button which says "Run anyway".  You only need to do this once and the
app will be allowed to run after that.

MacOS
-----

SeqMonk is distributed as a dmg file which is a virtual filesystem on a mac.  Just
download the dmg file and double click on it.  You will see the seqmonk app appear in a 
finder window.  Simply drag it from there to your Applications folder to install it.  
If you don't have administrator rights on your Mac then you can drag SeqMonk to any
other folder to run it, but you will then only be able to read and save data to your
home directory.

Since seqmonk is not a signed application, the first time you want to launch it
right click (or control click) on the app and select Open (rather than double clicking). 
You should then be prompted as to whether you trust this application.  If you say yes then
you will be able to open it by double clicking in future.  If the app doesn't open then
go to your OS preferences and look in the security section.  There will be a message saying
that the app was blocked, and giving you an option to unblock it.  Once you've done that
then it will work as normal.

When first installed, the security settings on OSX will restrict which parts of your
filesystem seqmonk can read from (only your home directory by default).  If seqmonk 
detects that it has only limited ability to read the filesystem it will put a notification
on the welcome screen with a pointer to instructions to grant it more permissions if
you want this.


Linux
-----

On linux seqmonk is distributed as a tar.gz file which contains a launch script and
an embedded java runtime.

You will need to extract the program from the tar file using something like:

tar -xzf seqmonk_v1.45.0_linux64.tar.gz

..but using whatever the file you downloaded is called.  You can then run the
program by using the launcher.

cd SeqMonk
./seqmonk

You can link (NOT COPY) the seqmonk launcher into somewhere like /usr/local/bin/ 
to allow you to run seqmonk from anywhere on your filesystem.


Configuring SeqMonk
--------------------
When you first run seqmonk you will be prompted to set up two file locations:

1. A cache file which will store temporary data used when seqmonk is running.  This 
   folder needs to be on a local disk (rather than a network drive) since lots of 
   data will be written to and read from it.  It will default to a folder called
   seqmonk_cache in your home directory, but you can change this.
   
2. A genomes folder which will hold a cache of the genome annotations for genomes 
   you use in your projects.  This folder will retain information between seqmonk
   sessions, but it can be re-downloaded at any point if lost so it doesn't need 
   to be backed up.  This will default to a folder called seqmonk_genomes in your
   home directory, but you can change this if you like.
   
 Once these are set up you can run seqmonk.  You can now optionally install and 
 configure R.

Configuring R
-------------
For some of the advanced statistical filters SeqMonk talks to a locally installed instance
of R to do the statistical analysis.  Configuring R is optional, and SeqMonk will run 
without it, but the R based filters and some of the graphical plots will not be available.

To configure SeqMonk and R you first need to install R on your system.  R can be downloaded
from http://www.r-project.org/ and you should follow the instructions there to load it.

For M1 Mac users - BioConductor doesn't (at the time of writing) natively support binary 
packages on the M1 based macs.  This means that although there is a native M1 build of R,
if you use that then you won't be able to install all of the packages without doing a full
recompilation.  The current advice from BioConductor is to install the normal Intel build
of R, even if you're on an M1 system, so it runs in emulation mode.  This will allow you 
to install Intel OSX binary packages, which will be easier than recompiling.  At some point
there will probably be native support for M1/ARM from BioConductor and this advice will 
change, but that's how it is right now.

For Linux users the installation of some R packages will require that you have 
suitable development tools installed. On Linux you should install the normal build environment on your system.  Many systems
will have this already, but you can explicitly install them with:

Ubuntu: sudo apt install build-essential

CentOS: sudo yum groupinstall "Development tools"

In addition you may need to install some additional development libraries.  The exact set 
can change over time, but the one which often crops up is the xml2-dev library

Ubuntu: sudo apt install libxml2-dev

CentOS: sudo yum install libxml2-devel

SeqMonk should prompt you to identify the location of your R installation (if it's not
found automatically), and will attempt to install any packages it requires for you during
initial setup.
